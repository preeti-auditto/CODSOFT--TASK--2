I am thrilled to announce that I have succesfully completed the TASK 2 of the CODSOFT internship in UI/UX design 
So basically I created an email template is a pre-designed email that can be used to send out
marketing or promotional emails. My goal was to create a good email template to make it
easy and quick for businesses to send out emails that look professional and engaging.
As the name and the design says that it is an advertisement of a boutique with an innovative name 
says "THE BOUTIQUE TIMES" showcasing amazing offers and new collections.
